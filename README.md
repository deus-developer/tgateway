Telegram Gateway Python SDK is a lightweight and asynchronous client library designed to interface with the [Telegram Gateway API](https://core.telegram.org/gateway). It provides a powerful and easy-to-use interface for sending and managing verification messages, checking their status, and revoking them. Alongside the SDK, the `tgateway` library also includes a CLI tool for performing these operations directly from the command line.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Send Verification Messages**: Deliver verification codes to users' phone numbers.
- **Check Delivery Status**: Verify the status of sent messages and handle callbacks.
- **Revoke Verification**: Invalidate previously sent verification messages.
- **Integrity Validation**: Ensure authenticity of incoming reports using signature validation.
- **Easy to Use**: Designed with simplicity and usability in mind.
- **Fully Asynchronous**: Built on `asyncio` for high-performance integration.
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Use the `TGateway CLI` to manage your interactions without writing code.

## üèóÔ∏è Installation

Install the SDK and CLI using pip:

```bash
pip install tgateway[cli]
```

## üìö SDK Usage

Here's a basic example to get started with the `TelegramGateway` client:

### Check a send verification message ability

```python
import asyncio
from tgateway import TelegramGateway

async def main():
    async with TelegramGateway(access_token="<access-token>") as gateway:
        result = await gateway.check_send_ability(
            phone_number="+1234567890",
        )

        print(f"Verification ability: {result}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Send a verification message

```python
import asyncio
from tgateway import TelegramGateway

async def main():
    async with TelegramGateway(access_token="<access-token>") as gateway:
        result = await gateway.send_verification_message(
            phone_number="+1234567890",
            code_length=6
        )

        print(f"Verification message sent: {result}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Check the Status of a Verification Request

```python
import asyncio
from tgateway import TelegramGateway

async def main():
    async with TelegramGateway(access_token="<access-token>") as gateway:
        result = await gateway.check_verification_status(request_id="<request-id>")

        print(f"Verification status: {result}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Revoke a Verification Message

```python
import asyncio
from tgateway import TelegramGateway

async def main():
    async with TelegramGateway(access_token="<access-token>") as gateway:
        result = await gateway.revoke_verification_message(request_id="<request-id>")

        print(f"Verification revoked: {result}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Validate Incoming Delivery Reports

To confirm the origin and integrity of incoming reports, you can use the `validate_report_integrity` method provided by the SDK:

```python
import asyncio
from tgateway import TelegramGateway


async def main():
    async with TelegramGateway(access_token="<access-token>") as gateway:
        try:
            gateway.validate_report_integrity(
                timestamp=123456789,  # Timestamp from header
                signature="report_signature",  # Signature from header
                body=b'{}'  # Body of the report as bytes
            )
            print("Report integrity validated successfully.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Validation failed: {e}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## üìö CLI Usage

The TGateway CLI is part of the `tgateway` library and provides an easy way to interact with the Telegram Gateway API using simple commands. Below is an overview of the available commands and their usage.

### Command Overview

The TGateway CLI provides several commands for interacting with the Telegram Gateway API:

1. `send`: Send a verification message to a phone number.
2. `ability`: Check the ability to send a message to a phone number.
3. `check`: Check the status of a previously sent verification request.
4. `revoke`: Revoke a previously sent verification message.
5. `--version`: Display the current version of the CLI and its dependencies.

### Sending a Verification Message

To send a verification message, use the `send` command:

```bash
tgateway send --access-token "<access-token>" --phone-number "+1234567890" [OPTIONS]
```

**Required Options:**

- `--access-token`: Your Telegram Gateway API access token.
- `--phone-number`: Phone number to send the verification message to, in E.164 format (e.g., "+1234567890").

**Optional Parameters:**

- `--request-id`: Use an existing request ID to resend a message free of charge.
- `--sender-username`: Username of the Telegram channel from which the code will be sent.
- `--code`: Custom verification code (4 to 8 characters, numeric).
- `--code-length`: Length of the verification code (if auto-generated). Supports values between 4 to 8.
- `--callback-url`: URL to receive delivery reports related to the sent message.
- `--ttl`: Time-to-live for the message in seconds before it expires.

**Example:**

```bash
tgateway send --access-token "<access-token>" --phone-number "+1234567890" --code-length 6
```

### Checking Send Ability for a Phone Number

To check if a verification message can be sent to a specific number:

```bash
tgateway ability --access-token "<access-token>" --phone-number "+1234567890"
```

### Checking the Status of a Verification Request

Check the status of a previously sent verification message using its `request-id`:

```bash
tgateway check --access-token "<access-token>" --request-id "<request-id>"
```

### Revoking a Verification Message

Revoke a sent verification message using the `request-id`:

```bash
tgateway revoke --access-token "<access-token>" --request-id "<request-id>"
```

### Show CLI Version

Check the version of the CLI, along with Python and system information:

```bash
tgateway --version
```

**Example Output:**

```
Running TGateway 0.1.0 with CPython 3.9.0 on Linux
```

### Command Help

Each command has its own help documentation. To view detailed information about a specific command, use:

```bash
tgateway <command> --help
```

For example:

```bash
tgateway send --help
```
